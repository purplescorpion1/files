The second stop of wave tour to debut in Rio de Janeiro with top athletes slated to battle for glory in renowned break. The tour leaders stamped their claim on the crown in the pure wave surfing contest in the legendary break of Cape Verde’s Ponta Preta. But the swell and wind in Saquarema can vary, with the effect that the contest may feature a mix of pure wave kite-surfing and strapless surfboard tricks, depending on the conditions. Thirty-five of the world’s best kite-surfing athletes—25 men and 10 women—from 14 nations around the globe are slated to battle for the crown in Saquarema. The spot on Saquarema’s Itauna Beach, a World Surf League stop last year, has a 12-day competition window to allow for the best possible conditions.</desc>

    <desc>THE HIGH is a feature length documentary film about the making of the longest high altitude foot race in the world. The film follows the path of a group of extreme runners who individually decide to take part of a dangerous running experiment gone wrong. Indian race director Rajat Chauhan works against the advice of the military, his family and friends to create a race over the two highest passes in the world (above 17 500ft). The decline begins from the start, with runners collapsing from dehydration, hypothermia, and high-altitude sickness. And by its end finds the entire race in jeopardy and the prospect that no one finishes. Brought to life by archive footage, story recreations, and interviews, the film unfolds the events in the Himalayas of Northern India and gives a unique look into the lives of the extreme marathon runners involved. Uncovering the avalanches, athletes, and the high altitude elements. THE HIGH shows the rewards of determination, the dangers of obsession, and in the end leaves you with the answer of why they called it, the toughest race on earth. Directed by Barry Walton.</desc>

    <title>Lines</title>
    <desc>Lines is a documentary on Big Mountain snowboarding that shows the dedication and nerve that goes into this under-represented side of snowboarding. It loosely follows the Absinthe Films crew as they post up in Haines, Alaska for 6 weeks and shows how taking freestyle into Big Mountain riding is the ultimate form of snowboarding. In between the current action, the movie fills out the characters with a historical look at the development of Big Mountain riding with the true legendary freeride pioneers. The film gives an inside look at the characters, history, dangers and logistics of Big Mountain riding, painting colorful and classic riding stories from past and present. &quot;A powerful, deeply moving film that takes you on a stirring journey straight to your heart.&quot; – Travis Rice “Big Mountain riding is the most visually stunning aspect of snowboarding, yet it remains the least understood. With Lines, Axel Pauporté has removed the sixty degrees of separation that exists between the weekend warrior and the Alaskan Warrlords. Riders like Nicolas Müller, Jeremy Jones, Travis Rice and Mike Ranquet tell it like it is and explain that more often than not, Big Mountain riding is gnarly, scary, sketchy and the ultimate snowboarding thrill.”</desc>

    <desc>Mission Antarctic - by Timeline Missions &amp; Camp 4 Collective. In 2008 Xavier de Le Rue, multiple freeride world champion and two times Olympian returned from a trip to Antarctica with mixed feelings, although he had the experience of a lifetime and discovered a new paradise he believed he had only scratched the surface of it. Since then, he worked on going back with his filming crew on a small boat to be completely independent. This documentary is about an expedition to the world’s end, a fair mix of navigation, mountaineering, snowboarding, wild life and unexpected discoveries. Release: 2013 Production: TimeLine Missions in collaboration with Camp 4 Collective Starring: Xavier de Le Rue &amp; Lucas Debari Original Score by: Aidan Lavelle &amp; James Carroll courtesy of Relentless.

    <title>Drawn From Here</title>
    <desc>Named Powder Magazine's &quot;Movie of the Year&quot; #DrawnFromHere is a film by Eric Pollard that opens with an exploration of his processes as a skier, as a ski/product designer, and as an artist. It follows the influences he draws from—like basing the shape of a ski tip off of a surfboard or finding patterns observed in nature to integrate into the graphics he hand draws for a ski—and illuminates a thread that runs through and binds all his different disciplines and hobbies. About Eric Pollard: EP is a professional skier, artist, and designer from Welches, Oregon. For 20 of his 36 years he’s been professionally sponsored as a skier, but what defines the whole of his career over that time goes well beyond that one simple fact.</desc>
